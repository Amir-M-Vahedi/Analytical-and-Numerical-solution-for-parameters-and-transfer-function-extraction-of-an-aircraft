# Analytical & Numerical solution for parameters and transfer function extraction of the given aircraft

## Overview
This project undertakes the analytical and numerical extraction of parameters and transfer functions for 20 aircraft detailed in Appendix B of Reference [1]. Utilizing MATLAB, we feed in-flight dynamic and aerodynamic data, applying established rules to calculate the requested parameters and transfer functions as listed in the provided image.

## Project Goals
- Extract crucial flight dynamic parameters and aerodynamic coefficients for a set of given aircraft.
- Determine transfer functions that are fundamental to the understanding of the aircraft's behavior under various flight conditions.

## Task List
The project includes the following tasks, each corresponding to vital aircraft stability and control parameters:
1. Find neutral point and aerodynamic center locations: $\ x_{AC}, x_{AC_{WB}}, x_{AC_{H}} \$, and $\ x_{AC_{V}} \$.
2. Calculate the static margin and maneuver point.
3. Assess longitudinal and lateral-directional static stability.
4. Identify the most forward and most-aft center of gravity (C.G.) locations.
5. Construct trim diagrams for specified C.G. positions.
6. Estimate elevator deflection $\ e_0 \$, rate of change of elevator deflection with respect to angle of attack $\ de/da \$, and thrust $\ T_e \$.
7. Perform coordinated level turns and calculate control surface hinge moments.
8. Analyze aircraft dynamic stability and modes for both longitudinal and lateral-directional dynamics.
9. Derive complete transfer functions.
10. Design an ideal Stability Augmentation System (SAS) to enhance damping characteristics.

## Methodology
1. **Parameter Definition**: Initialize MATLAB variables with the relevant data from Appendix B of Reference [1].
2. **Rule Application**: Apply flight dynamic principles and aerodynamic rules to calculate parameters.
3. **Transfer Function Extraction**: Use MATLAB's Control System Toolbox to derive transfer functions.
4. **Comparison and Analysis**: Tabulate the extracted values against approximations from the literature for validation.

## Conclusion
This project lays the groundwork for detailed flight dynamics analysis through MATLAB, enabling in-depth stability and control studies for various aircraft types. By systematically extracting and validating key parameters and transfer functions, we enhance the understanding of aircraft performance, providing a foundation for further research and development in aircraft design and control systems.
